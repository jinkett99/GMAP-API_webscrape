This example notebook demonstrate a simple script and helper functions required to run a Google Map (GMAP) API call to retrieve business websites of the companies listed.
Script also includes a security feature to cache responses in output csv file after every 5000 iterations.
Datasets are NOT included due to classified business information (restricted/sensitive data). 
Conclusions: The new Google Map API allows for multiple use-cases and information extraction from google maps using only an input list of business names and UENs.
Business website information allows for Statisticians to study the "business-risk" and "business-health" landscape through feature extraction from website-text data.
